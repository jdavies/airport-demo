# Database ReadMe

The ```create.cql``` file is the workhorse here. Use it to create you tables. You may also wish to create a ```setenv.sh``` file that contains the connection information specific to your database. For example:

```sh
export client_id="<your client/database ID>"
export client_secret="<your client secret>"
export token="<your database token>"
```
